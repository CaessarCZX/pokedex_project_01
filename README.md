This is a repository with a small vanilla JS pokedex project.

**This project is part of a collaborative work with my classmates in the DEV.F program.**

Is a team project focused on building an interactive web platform to explore the exciting world of Pokémon. 
Utilizing the latest EcmaScript (ES6+) features and the PokeAPI, the team developed a modern and elegant 
Pokedex that allows users to access detailed information about their favorite Pokémon.
